# veryCleanNN
My personal project to learn python and actually apply maths. 

# Aim 
The aim of this project is to build a neural network from scratch to learn python on the go and really understand the maths behind deep learning. I am using this as an opportunity to dive into machine learning, before using external libraries and potentially use this very clean neural network for future projects.
